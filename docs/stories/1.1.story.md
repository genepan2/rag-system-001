# Story 1.1: Monorepo and CI/CD Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up a monorepo with a basic CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** we have a unified codebase and automated deployments from the start.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is initialized with separate packages for the frontend (web) and backend (api).
2. A basic CI/CD pipeline is configured to deploy both packages on a push to the main branch.
3. The deployed application shows a simple "Hello World" or placeholder page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Initialize monorepo structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create root package.json with workspaces configuration
  - [x] Set up apps/web directory for Next.js application
  - [x] Configure TypeScript config files (root and workspace-specific)
  - [x] Create shared packages/tsconfig directory
- [x] Task 2: Set up Next.js application foundation (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Initialize Next.js 14.x project in apps/web
  - [x] Configure basic app directory structure with layout.tsx and page.tsx
  - [x] Create simple "Hello World" placeholder page
  - [x] Set up Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling
- [x] Task 3: Configure Vercel CI/CD pipeline (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create vercel.json configuration file
  - [x] Set up automatic deployments from main branch
  - [x] Configure build settings for monorepo structure
  - [x] Verify deployment works with placeholder page
- [x] Task 4: Create environment configuration template (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create .env.local.example with Supabase and API key placeholders
  - [x] Document environment setup in development workflow
- [x] Task 5: Add basic testing setup (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Configure Jest 29.x for unit testing
  - [x] Set up React Testing Library for component tests
  - [x] Create initial test structure and example tests

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story - this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.x with TypeScript 5.x, Tailwind CSS 3.x
- **CI/CD**: Vercel for continuous deployment from Git
- **Testing**: Jest 29.x for unit and integration testing
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x across entire stack for consistency

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]
Required monorepo structure:
```
rag-system/
├── apps/
│   └── web/                  # The Next.js fullstack application
│       ├── app/
│       │   ├── api/          # Backend API Routes (future stories)
│       │   ├── (components)/ # UI Components (future stories)
│       │   ├── (lib)/        # Shared library code (future stories)
│       │   ├── layout.tsx    # Root layout
│       │   └── page.tsx      # Main page component
│       ├── public/
│       └── package.json
├── packages/
│   └── tsconfig/             # Shared TypeScript configs
├── .env.local.example        # Environment variable template
├── package.json              # Root package.json with workspaces
└── tsconfig.json             # Root TypeScript config
```

### Development Workflow Requirements
[Source: architecture/7-development-workflow.md]
- Node.js v20+ required
- Root-level npm install for workspace management
- Development command: `npm run dev` starts Next.js development server
- Environment setup requires Supabase account and API keys

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Frontend Tests**: Jest and React Testing Library for UI component testing
- **Backend Tests**: Unit tests for API route handlers (future stories)
- Test files should ensure components render correctly
- Integration tests to be added post-MVP

### Technical Constraints
- Must use managed infrastructure (Vercel + Supabase) to simplify MVP setup
- Zero-config CI/CD approach using Vercel's built-in capabilities
- TypeScript strict mode across all packages for type safety
