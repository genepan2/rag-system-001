# Story 1.2: Basic UI Shell

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a non-functional UI shell with a text input and a display area,
**so that** we have the basic layout for the query interface in place.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The UI displays a large text input field at the top/center of the page.
2. A "Submit" button is present next to the input field.
3. Below the input, there is a designated area where answers will eventually be displayed.
4. The page is responsive.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create UI component structure (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Design the main page layout with input field at top/center
  - [x] Add large text input field (textarea or input)
  - [x] Add Submit button positioned next to input field
  - [x] Create designated display area below input for future answers
- [x] Task 2: Implement responsive design (AC: 4)
  - [x] Use Tailwind CSS responsive utilities for mobile/tablet/desktop
  - [x] Test layout on different screen sizes
  - [x] Ensure input field and button stack properly on mobile
- [x] Task 3: Update page.tsx with new UI shell (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Replace existing placeholder content with query interface
  - [x] Implement proper TypeScript types for component props
  - [x] Follow Next.js 14 app directory patterns
- [x] Task 4: Add basic component tests (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Create test file in __tests__ directory
  - [x] Test that input field renders correctly
  - [x] Test that submit button is present
  - [x] Test that display area is present
  - [x] Test responsive behavior

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: Monorepo structure is established with Next.js 14.x, Tailwind CSS 3.x configured, and testing setup with Jest and React Testing Library is in place.

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.x with React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.x for utility-first CSS framework
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x for type safety across UI components
- **Testing**: Jest 29.x with React Testing Library for component testing

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]
- Main page component: `apps/web/app/page.tsx`
- UI Components directory: `apps/web/app/(components)/ui/` (for future component extraction)
- Test files location: `apps/web/__tests__/` directory
- Follow Next.js app directory structure with proper file naming

### Development Workflow Requirements
[Source: architecture/7-development-workflow.md]
- Development server: `npm run dev` starts Next.js development server
- Local development requires Node.js v20+
- Root-level npm install manages workspace dependencies

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Frontend Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library for UI component testing
- Test files should ensure components render correctly
- Component tests should verify UI elements are present and functional
- Test responsive behavior to ensure mobile compatibility

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing Tailwind CSS configuration from Story 1.1
- Follow TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Use Next.js 14 app directory patterns (not pages directory)
- Ensure responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

### Component Specifications
Based on acceptance criteria, the UI shell should include:
- Large text input field (textarea recommended for multi-line queries)
- Submit button positioned adjacent to input (right side or below)
- Display area below input (div or section element for future content)
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
