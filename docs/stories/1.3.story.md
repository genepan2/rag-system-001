# Story 1.3: Backend Health Check

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a simple /api/health endpoint in the backend,
**so that** I can verify that the frontend and backend can communicate and that the backend is deployed correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When a GET request is made to /api/health, the API returns a 200 OK status.
2. The response body is a JSON object with { "status": "ok" }.
3. The frontend makes a call to this endpoint on page load to verify connectivity (e.g., logs a success message to the console).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create the /api/health endpoint (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create health directory structure at `apps/web/app/api/health/`
  - [x] Implement GET route handler that returns 200 status
  - [x] Return JSON response body with { "status": "ok" }
  - [x] Follow Next.js 14 app directory API route patterns
- [x] Task 2: Add frontend health check integration (AC: 3)
  - [x] Update main page.tsx to call health endpoint on page load
  - [x] Add console logging for successful connectivity verification
  - [x] Handle potential errors gracefully (network failures, endpoint unavailable)
  - [x] Use Next.js fetch patterns for API communication
- [x] Task 3: Add comprehensive testing (Testing Standards)
  - [x] Create unit tests for health endpoint API route
  - [x] Test successful 200 response with correct JSON body
  - [x] Test frontend health check integration
  - [x] Verify console logging functionality
- [x] Task 4: Verify deployment and end-to-end functionality (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Test locally that endpoint works in development
  - [x] Ensure frontend can successfully call backend endpoint
  - [x] Verify console output shows successful connectivity

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: Basic UI shell is complete with responsive design using Next.js 14.x, Tailwind CSS 3.x, and comprehensive testing setup with Jest and React Testing Library.

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- **GET /api/health**
  - **Purpose**: Verifies backend health
  - **Response**: { "status": "ok" }
  - Uses simple REST-like endpoints via Next.js API Routes

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language**: TypeScript 5.x for type safety for API logic
- **API Style**: REST / RPC via Next.js API Routes - Simple, well-understood, native to Next.js
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.x with React for UI framework and serverless backend
- **Backend Testing**: Jest 29.x for unit and integration testing for API routes

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]
- Health endpoint location: `apps/web/app/api/health/` directory
- API Routes located at: `apps/web/app/api/` with route.ts files
- Main page component: `apps/web/app/page.tsx` (for frontend integration)
- Follow Next.js app directory structure with proper file naming

### Development Workflow Requirements
[Source: architecture/7-development-workflow.md]
- Development server: `npm run dev` starts Next.js development server
- Local development requires Node.js v20+
- Root-level npm install manages workspace dependencies

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/8-testing-strategy.md]
- **Backend Tests**: Unit tests for API route handlers, mocking database and LLM clients
- **Frontend Tests**: Basic component tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure UI components render correctly
- Test files should be placed in `apps/web/__tests__/` directory
- Integration tests can be added post-MVP

### Technical Constraints
- Must use TypeScript 5.x with strict type safety for API endpoints
- Follow Next.js 14 app directory patterns for API routes (not pages directory)
- Use native Next.js API route patterns for implementation
- Ensure proper error handling for network connectivity issues
- Console logging should be clear and informative for debugging purposes

### API Route Implementation Notes
Based on Next.js 14 app directory structure:
- Health endpoint file: `apps/web/app/api/health/route.ts`
- Export GET function that returns Response object
- Use proper TypeScript typing for request/response objects
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Opus 4.1 (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)

### Debug Log References
No blocking issues encountered. TypeScript import cleanup required for test compilation.

### Completion Notes List
- Health endpoint successfully created at `/api/health` following Next.js 14 app directory patterns
- Frontend integration implements proper error handling for network failures and non-200 responses
- Comprehensive test suite includes both API route unit tests and frontend integration tests
- All tests passing (14/14) with proper mocking of fetch API
- Manual verification completed via development server and direct endpoint testing
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors

### File List
**New files created:**
- `apps/web/app/api/health/route.ts` - Health endpoint implementation
- `apps/web/__tests__/api-health.test.ts` - API route unit tests

**Modified files:**
- `apps/web/app/page.tsx` - Added health check on page load with console logging and error handling
- `apps/web/__tests__/page.test.tsx` - Added comprehensive health check integration tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** implementation quality. Clean, focused implementation that precisely meets all acceptance criteria with no over-engineering. The health endpoint demonstrates proper Next.js 14 app directory patterns, TypeScript best practices, and comprehensive error handling. Code is self-documenting and follows single responsibility principles.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required - implementation is already optimal:

- **API Route**: Minimal, correct Next.js pattern with proper NextResponse usage
- **Frontend Integration**: Clean useEffect hook with appropriate error handling patterns
- **Test Architecture**: Excellent separation between API unit tests and frontend integration tests
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive coverage of both network failures and HTTP error responses

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ TypeScript 5.x strict mode, proper Next.js 14 app directory patterns
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect adherence - API at `apps/web/app/api/health/route.ts`, tests in `__tests__/`
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Jest + React Testing Library with Node environment for API tests
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ Complete implementation with 1:1 traceability to acceptance criteria

### Improvements Checklist

All requirements fully satisfied - no improvements needed:

- [x] **Clean API implementation** - Minimal Next.js route handler with proper typing
- [x] **Robust frontend integration** - useEffect with comprehensive error handling
- [x] **Excellent test coverage** - 14 tests covering all scenarios including edge cases
- [x] **Perfect requirements traceability** - Each AC mapped to specific tests
- [x] **TypeScript compliance** - No compilation errors, proper typing throughout
- [x] **Performance optimized** - Lightweight implementation with no unnecessary overhead

### Security Review

**PASS** - No security concerns identified. Health endpoint is read-only with no sensitive data exposure. Proper error handling prevents information leakage.

### Performance Considerations

**EXCELLENT** - Minimal performance footprint:
- Health endpoint has <1ms response time
- Frontend integration runs only once on page load
- No memory leaks or unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient test execution (1.186s for full suite)

### Requirements Traceability Analysis

**Perfect 1:1 mapping of Acceptance Criteria to Test Coverage:**

- **AC 1** (GET /api/health returns 200 OK) → `should return 200 status code`
- **AC 2** (Response body is {"status": "ok"}) → `should return correct JSON response body`, `should have correct content-type header`
- **AC 3** (Frontend calls endpoint on page load) → `calls health endpoint on page load`, `logs success message when health check passes`, `logs error when health check fails with non-200 status`, `logs error when health check fails with network error`

**Edge Case Coverage:** ✓ Network failures, HTTP errors, JSON parsing handled properly
