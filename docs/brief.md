# Project Brief: Internal Documentation RAG System

## Executive Summary

This project aims to develop an internal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The primary problem this system solves is the difficulty employees face in finding specific information within a large repository of company documentation. By leveraging a conversational AI interface, the system will allow employees (the target market) to ask questions in natural language and receive precise, context-aware answers drawn directly from the documents, significantly improving knowledge accessibility and efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Currently, our internal documentation is spread across various sources, and the existing search functionality is keyword-based and often ineffective. This leads to several pain points:
* **Wasted Time:** Employees spend a significant amount of time searching for information instead of performing their core tasks.
* **Inconsistent Knowledge:** Different employees find conflicting or outdated information, leading to inconsistent work.
* **Onboarding Delays:** New hires struggle to find the necessary documentation to become productive quickly.
* **Underutilized Resources:** Valuable knowledge within the documentation is effectively lost because it cannot be easily discovered.

Existing solutions like standard keyword search fail because they lack contextual understanding and cannot synthesize information from multiple sources to provide a direct answer.

## Proposed Solution

We propose building a web-based RAG application that provides a simple, conversational interface for all employees. The core of the solution will be an AI pipeline that:
1.  Ingests and processes internal company documents into a searchable vector database.
2.  Allows users to ask questions in natural language.
3.  Retrieves the most relevant document excerpts based on the user's query.
4.  Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a concise, synthesized answer based on the retrieved context.
5.  Provides direct links to the source documents for verification and deeper reading.

This solution will succeed by providing direct, accurate answers instead of just a list of links, becoming the single source of truth for documented knowledge.

## Target Users

* **Primary User Segment: All Employees** - Anyone needing to find information in company documentation, from new hires to senior staff.
* **Secondary User Segment: Content Curators** - Individuals responsible for managing and updating the documentation that feeds the system.

## Goals & Success Metrics

* **Business Objectives:**
    * Reduce employee time spent searching for information by 30% within 6 months post-launch.
    * Increase the utilization of internal documentation by 50%.
* **User Success Metrics:**
    * Users successfully find the correct answer to their query 85% of the time.
    * High user satisfaction score (4/5 or higher) through feedback surveys.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    * Daily/Monthly Active Users.
    * Average number of queries per user.
    * Percentage of queries that receive a "helpful" rating from users.

## MVP Scope

* **Core Features (Must Have):**
    * A simple web interface with a single input field for asking questions.
    * Backend service to ingest and process an initial set of documents (e.g., Markdown files from a specific Git repository).
    * Core RAG pipeline for query processing, retrieval, and answer generation.
    * Display of the generated answer with citations/links to the source document(s).
* **Out of Scope for MVP:**
    * Ingestion of multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
    * User authentication or document-level permissions.
    * User feedback mechanism within the UI.
    * Conversation history.
    * Advanced administrative dashboard.

## Post-MVP Vision

* **Phase 2 Features:**
    * Support for additional data sources (Confluence, Google Drive, PDFs).
    * Integration with Slack or Microsoft Teams for asking questions directly from chat.
    * User feedback loop (thumbs up/down) to improve answer quality.
* **Long-term Vision:**
    * Implement role-based access control for sensitive documents.
    * Provide analytics on most frequently asked questions to identify knowledge gaps.

## Technical Considerations (Initial Thoughts)

* **Platform Requirements:** Web-based, responsive for desktop and mobile browsers.
* **Technology Preferences (To be validated by Architect):**
    * **Backend:** Python (leveraging libraries like LangChain, LlamaIndex).
    * **Frontend:** A modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React/Next.js).
    * **Database:** A vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB).
    * **Hosting/Infrastructure:** A cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
* **Integration Requirements:** Initial integration with a Git repository for document sourcing.

## Constraints & Assumptions

* **Constraints:**
    * **Timeline:** MVP to be delivered within one quarter.
    * **Technical:** Must integrate with our existing cloud provider.
* **Key Assumptions:**
    * The initial set of documentation is well-structured and in a machine-readable format (Markdown).
    * An LLM API (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini) is available and budgeted for.
    * Employees will adopt the new tool over existing search methods.

## Risks & Open Questions

* **Key Risks:**
    * **Accuracy:** The system may provide incorrect or "hallucinated" answers.
    * **Cost:** LLM API usage could become expensive at scale.
    * **Adoption:** Employees may not trust or use the new system.
* **Open Questions:**
    * How will we handle document permissions and access control post-MVP?
    * What is the process for keeping the document index up-to-date?
    * What is the budget for ongoing operational costs (LLM APIs, hosting)?

## Next Steps

This Project Brief provides the initial context. The next step is to hand this off to the Product Manager to begin creating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).
