# **1. Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

* Significantly reduce the time employees spend searching for information.
* Become the trusted, primary source for accessing documented company knowledge.
* Provide accurate, synthesized answers to natural language questions, citing sources for verification.
* Improve the onboarding experience for new hires by providing instant access to information.

## **Background Context**

Our current internal documentation is extensive but difficult to navigate with traditional keyword search. This inefficiency leads to wasted time and inconsistent knowledge across the company. This project will build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to solve this by providing a conversational interface that delivers direct, context-aware answers from our documents, fundamentally changing how employees access and utilize company knowledge.
