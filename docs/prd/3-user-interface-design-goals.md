# **3. User Interface Design Goals**

* **Overall UX Vision:** A clean, minimalist, single-purpose interface that feels like a private search engine. The user experience should be centered entirely on the act of asking a question and receiving an answer.
* **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The primary interaction is a simple "ask-and-receive" loop. The user types a question, submits it, and waits for the answer to appear in the same view.
* **Core Screens and Views:** For the MVP, a single screen is required: the "Query Interface". This screen will contain the input field, submit button, and a display area for the answer and its sources.
* **Accessibility:** The application should adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
* **Branding:** To be determined. For the MVP, a simple, professional, and clean design with a neutral color palette will be used.
* **Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive, ensuring usability on modern desktop and mobile browsers.
