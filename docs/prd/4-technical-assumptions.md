# **4. Technical Assumptions**

* **Repository Structure:** Monorepo. This will simplify sharing code and types between the frontend and backend applications.
* **Service Architecture:** Serverless functions (e.g., Next.js API routes, AWS Lambda) will be used for the backend to ensure scalability and manage costs.
* **Testing Requirements:** All functional requirements must be covered by a combination of unit and integration tests.
* **Additional Technical Assumptions:** The project will rely on a third-party LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic) and a managed vector database service (e.g., Pinecone).
