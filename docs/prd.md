# **RAG System Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **1. Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

* Significantly reduce the time employees spend searching for information.
* Become the trusted, primary source for accessing documented company knowledge.
* Provide accurate, synthesized answers to natural language questions, citing sources for verification.
* Improve the onboarding experience for new hires by providing instant access to information.

### **Background Context**

Our current internal documentation is extensive but difficult to navigate with traditional keyword search. This inefficiency leads to wasted time and inconsistent knowledge across the company. This project will build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to solve this by providing a conversational interface that delivers direct, context-aware answers from our documents, fundamentally changing how employees access and utilize company knowledge.

## **2. Requirements**

### **Functional Requirements**

* **FR1:** The system must ingest and process Markdown documents from a specified public Git repository.
* **FR2:** The system must parse the documents into manageable text chunks suitable for embedding.
* **FR3:** The system must convert text chunks into vector embeddings and store them in a vector database.
* **FR4:** The system must provide a web-based user interface with a text input field for users to submit questions.
* **FR5:** The system must accept a user's natural language question and find the most relevant document chunks from the vector database.
* **FR6:** The system must use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a synthesized answer based on the user's question and the retrieved document chunks.
* **FR7:** The system must display the generated answer to the user in the web interface.
* **FR8:** The system must display citations or links to the source documents from which the answer was derived.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR1:** The user interface must be simple, intuitive, and require no user training.
* **NFR2:** The system should return an answer to a typical query in under 10 seconds.
* **NFR3:** The system's cloud and API costs should be monitored and optimized for efficiency.
* **NFR4:** The architecture should be scalable to support a larger volume of documents and user queries post-MVP.

## **3. User Interface Design Goals**

* **Overall UX Vision:** A clean, minimalist, single-purpose interface that feels like a private search engine. The user experience should be centered entirely on the act of asking a question and receiving an answer.
* **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The primary interaction is a simple "ask-and-receive" loop. The user types a question, submits it, and waits for the answer to appear in the same view.
* **Core Screens and Views:** For the MVP, a single screen is required: the "Query Interface". This screen will contain the input field, submit button, and a display area for the answer and its sources.
* **Accessibility:** The application should adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
* **Branding:** To be determined. For the MVP, a simple, professional, and clean design with a neutral color palette will be used.
* **Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive, ensuring usability on modern desktop and mobile browsers.

## **4. Technical Assumptions**

* **Repository Structure:** Monorepo. This will simplify sharing code and types between the frontend and backend applications.
* **Service Architecture:** Serverless functions (e.g., Next.js API routes, AWS Lambda) will be used for the backend to ensure scalability and manage costs.
* **Testing Requirements:** All functional requirements must be covered by a combination of unit and integration tests.
* **Additional Technical Assumptions:** The project will rely on a third-party LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic) and a managed vector database service (e.g., Pinecone).

## **5. Epic List**

* **Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Infrastructure:** Establish the project monorepo, a basic UI shell, a backend health-check API, and a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
* **Epic 2: Document Ingestion Pipeline:** Develop the backend services required to pull documents from a Git repository, process them into vector embeddings, and store them in the vector database.
* **Epic 3: RAG Core Loop & User Interface:** Implement the end-to-end functionality for a user to ask a question, have the system retrieve context, generate an answer, and display the results with sources.

## **6. Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Infrastructure**

**Epic Goal:** To create the foundational structure of the full-stack application, including the repository setup, a deployable placeholder UI, a basic backend endpoint, and the continuous deployment pipeline.

* **Story 1.1: Monorepo and CI/CD Setup**
  * **As a** developer,
  * **I want** to set up a monorepo with a basic CI/CD pipeline,
  * **so that** we have a unified codebase and automated deployments from the start.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. A monorepo is initialized with separate packages for the frontend (web) and backend (api).
    2. A basic CI/CD pipeline is configured to deploy both packages on a push to the main branch.
    3. The deployed application shows a simple "Hello World" or placeholder page.
* **Story 1.2: Basic UI Shell**
  * **As a** developer,
  * **I want** to create a non-functional UI shell with a text input and a display area,
  * **so that** we have the basic layout for the query interface in place.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. The UI displays a large text input field at the top/center of the page.
    2. A "Submit" button is present next to the input field.
    3. Below the input, there is a designated area where answers will eventually be displayed.
    4. The page is responsive.
* **Story 1.3: Backend Health Check**
  * **As a** developer,
  * **I want** to create a simple /api/health endpoint in the backend,
  * **so that** I can verify that the frontend and backend can communicate and that the backend is deployed correctly.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. When a GET request is made to /api/health, the API returns a 200 OK status.
    2. The response body is a JSON object with { "status": "ok" }.
    3. The frontend makes a call to this endpoint on page load to verify connectivity (e.g., logs a success message to the console).

## **7. Epic 2: Document Ingestion Pipeline**

**Epic Goal:** To build the automated pipeline that ingests Markdown documents from a source repository and makes them available for querying in a vector database.

* **Story 2.1: Document Source Connector**
  * **As a** system,
  * **I want** to clone a specified public Git repository containing Markdown documents,
  * **so that** I can access the raw content for processing.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. An API endpoint (e.g., POST /api/ingest) exists to trigger the process.
    2. The service successfully clones the repository specified in an environment variable to a temporary location.
    3. The service can list all .md files within the cloned repository.
* **Story 2.2: Document Processing and Vectorization**
  * **As a** system,
  * **I want** to read the Markdown files, split them into text chunks, and convert them to vector embeddings,
  * **so that** they can be stored and searched semantically.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. Markdown files are read and their text content is extracted.
    2. The text is split into chunks of a predefined size (e.g., 1000 characters).
    3. Each chunk is sent to an embedding model API, and a vector embedding is received.
    4. Each chunk is associated with its source document name.
* **Story 2.3: Vector Database Storage**
  * **As a** system,
  * **I want** to store the vector embeddings and their corresponding text chunks in the vector database,
  * **so that** they are indexed and ready for querying.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. The system successfully connects to the vector database.
    2. For each text chunk, its vector embedding and metadata (source document, text content) are successfully saved to the database.
    3. The ingestion endpoint returns a success message with the count of documents processed.

## **8. Epic 3: RAG Core Loop & User Interface**

**Epic Goal:** To implement the full, end-to-end user-facing experience of asking a question and receiving a generated answer with sources.

* **Story 3.1: Backend Query Endpoint**
  * **As a** developer,
  * **I want** a backend endpoint that accepts a user's question,
  * **so that** the RAG process can be initiated from the UI.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. A POST /api/query endpoint exists that accepts a JSON payload with a question field.
    2. The endpoint vectorizes the incoming question using the same embedding model as the ingestion pipeline.
    3. It uses the question vector to query the vector database and retrieve the top k (e.g., 5\) most relevant text chunks.
    4. It constructs a prompt containing the user's question and the retrieved text chunks.
* **Story 3.2: LLM Answer Generation**
  * **As a** system,
  * **I want** to send the constructed prompt to an LLM and receive a synthesized answer,
  * **so that** I can provide a direct answer to the user's question.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. The system successfully calls the configured LLM API with the prompt.
    2. The LLM's text response is captured.
    3. The source documents associated with the retrieved chunks are identified.
    4. The endpoint returns a JSON response containing the generated answer and a list of the source document names.
* **Story 3.3: Frontend Integration and Display**
  * **As a** user,
  * **I want** to type my question, click "Submit", and see the answer appear on the screen,
  * **so that** I can get information easily.
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. When the user clicks "Submit", the question from the input field is sent to the POST /api/query endpoint.
    2. While waiting for a response, a loading indicator is displayed.
    3. When the response is received, the generated answer is displayed clearly in the answer area.
    4. The list of source documents is displayed as clickable links below the answer.
    5. If an error occurs, a user-friendly error message is shown.
