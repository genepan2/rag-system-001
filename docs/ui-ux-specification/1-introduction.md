# **1. Introduction**

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the RAG System's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

* **Target User Personas:**
  * **Primary:** All employees, regardless of technical skill, who need quick and accurate answers from documentation.
* **Usability Goals:**
  * **Ease of learning:** A new user should understand how to use the application within 10 seconds.
  * **Efficiency of use:** A user should be able to ask a question and get an answer with a maximum of two clicks (one to focus the input, one to submit).
  * **Error prevention:** The interface should be so simple that user error is nearly impossible.
* **Design Principles:**
  1. **Clarity Above All:** The interface must be immediately understandable.
  2. **Focus on the Core Task:** Everything on the screen should serve the primary goal of asking and answering questions. No distractions.
  3. **Provide Trust and Transparency:** Clearly cite sources so users can trust the answers and verify the information.
  4. **Instant Feedback:** The system should always communicate its current state (e.g., loading, processing, error).
