# **RAG System UI/UX Specification**

## **1. Introduction**

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the RAG System's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

* **Target User Personas:**
  * **Primary:** All employees, regardless of technical skill, who need quick and accurate answers from documentation.
* **Usability Goals:**
  * **Ease of learning:** A new user should understand how to use the application within 10 seconds.
  * **Efficiency of use:** A user should be able to ask a question and get an answer with a maximum of two clicks (one to focus the input, one to submit).
  * **Error prevention:** The interface should be so simple that user error is nearly impossible.
* **Design Principles:**
  1. **Clarity Above All:** The interface must be immediately understandable.
  2. **Focus on the Core Task:** Everything on the screen should serve the primary goal of asking and answering questions. No distractions.
  3. **Provide Trust and Transparency:** Clearly cite sources so users can trust the answers and verify the information.
  4. **Instant Feedback:** The system should always communicate its current state (e.g., loading, processing, error).

## **2. Information Architecture (IA)**

* **Site Map / Screen Inventory:** For the MVP, the application consists of a single screen.

* **Navigation Structure:** No formal navigation is required for the MVP. The entire application exists on a single page.

## **3. User Flows**

### **Core User Flow: Asking a Question**

* **User Goal:** To get a direct, accurate answer to a question about internal documentation.
* **Entry Points:** The user lands directly on the Query Interface.
* **Success Criteria:** The user receives a helpful answer and knows which document(s) it came from.
* **Flow Diagram:**

      User-\>\>UI: Types question into input field
      User-\>\>UI: Clicks "Submit" button
      UI-\>\>+System: Sends question to backend
      UI--\>\>User: Shows loading indicator
      System--\>\>-UI: Returns answer and sources
      UI--\>\>User: Displays formatted answer
      UI--\>\>User: Displays clickable source links

* **Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
  * If the system returns an error, the UI displays a user-friendly message like "Sorry, I couldn't process that question. Please try rephrasing it."
  * If no relevant documents are found, the UI displays "I couldn't find an answer in the current documents for that question."
  * The submit button should be disabled while a request is in progress.

## **4. Wireframes & Mockups**

* **Primary Design Files:** (To be created in Figma, link will be placed here)
* **Key Screen Layouts: Query Interface**
  * **Purpose:** To provide a single, focused interface for the user's task.
  * **Key Elements:**
    * A prominent, centered page title (e.g., "Documentation Q\&A").
    * A large text area for the user's question.
    * A clear "Submit" or "Ask" button.
    * A dedicated "Answer" section, initially empty.
    * A "Sources" section, initially empty.
  * **Interaction Notes:**
    * Pressing 'Enter' in the text area should also trigger the submission.
    * The answer should be streamed into the display area if possible to improve perceived performance.
    * Source links should open the source document in a new tab.

## **5. Branding & Style Guide**

* **Color Palette:**
  * **Primary:** A professional blue (e.g., \#0052CC) for buttons and links.
  * **Neutral:** Shades of gray for text (e.g., \#172B4D), backgrounds (e.g., \#FFFFFF), and borders (e.g., \#DFE1E6).
  * **Success:** A green for success notifications (e.g., \#00875A).
  * **Error:** A red for error messages (e.g., \#DE350B).
* **Typography:**
  * **Font Families:** A clean, sans-serif font like "Inter" or "Helvetica Neue".
  * **Type Scale:** Clear hierarchy for title (H1), answer text (Body), and source links (Small).
* **Iconography:**
  * Minimal icons needed. A paperclip or book icon for sources could be used. A simple spinner for loading.
* **Spacing & Layout:**
  * A centered, max-width layout to ensure readability on large screens. Generous white space to promote focus.

## **6. Accessibility Requirements**

* **Compliance Target:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
* **Key Requirements:**
  * All interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable.
  * Sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds.
  * The loading state must be announced by screen readers.
  * Forms must have proper labels.

## **7. Responsiveness Strategy**

* **Breakpoints:**
  * **Mobile (\< 768px):** A single-column layout. The text input will span the width of the screen.
  * **Desktop (\>= 768px):** A centered layout with a maximum width (e.g., 800px) to prevent text lines from becoming too long and hard to read.

## **8. Next Steps**

* **Immediate Actions:**
  1. Review this specification with stakeholders for alignment.
  2. Create high-fidelity mockups in Figma based on this document.
  3. Proceed with the creation of the Fullstack Architecture document.
